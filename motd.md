# MOTD/Daily Start

(Should not take more than 10-15 minutes)

## First Thing
- Start “Be Focused” app
- Read MOTD

## MOTD
- One day at a time
- I will do the best I can do. That’s all that’s expected.
- Don’t worry about things you can’t control.

- Always be vigilant with your condition. You always have it, even when you’re feeling good. Assume it could go south at any time.
- Visualize success developing with voiceover. Accessible development is your thing now. Own it.
- If you can master VoiceOver development, you will have mastered this condition.
- Everything you learn and practice today will help you in the long run. So just do it
- You are still learning this stuff - don’t worry if it is slow and frustrating for now.
- This is now an experiment in how much you can do when in a “bad state”
- Always look softly. Be aware of the peripheral. Move gaze and focus slowly; don’t dart around
- Take breaks regularly and don’t be afraid to stop for a bit if you need to

- Live your life, every day! It’s OK to be happy and enjoy yourself. Don’t feel guilty about it.

- Stay focused, stay engaged
- Don’t over-think stuff - get going!
